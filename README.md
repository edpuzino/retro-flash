## How To:
### Create User Name
###### A user name is created when the user inputs his or her information into the login box and selects the submit button (see home page). Each user name is stored locally to the users file system and will not be available outside of their local device. 
### Play the Game 
###### The game is initiated when the user selects a category (see play the game) . The user is presented with multiple choice answers for a single question. Upon selection of a correct answer the user is awarded 50 points. Upon selection of an incorrect answer the user is penalized 10 points. 
### Win
###### Winning the game is determined by the users ability to place on the leader board (see leader board) and remove a pre-exsisting user by obtaining a higher total score. 

**Brief Description of Project**
This project is an 80's movie trivia game that consists of 6 catagories: Action, Horror, Cult, Chevy Chase, Scifi, and Movie Magic. This project demonstrates the authors current abilities with CSS, JavaScript, and HTML elements.

**Problem Domain**
The purposed purpose of this project is to create a website where users can answer trivia questions, track their score, and submit questions for other users. We identified that there was a need for a fun, creative, and free website. Our website solves the problems of; having something to do on a lunch break, showing off your prowess in 80s movie trivia, boredom while waiting for public tranportation/food/children to find their shoes, and most importantly a place to nerd out with other nerds by creating a nerd community online.
